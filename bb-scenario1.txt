Hello Zoom Security,

I have found the following vulnerability in your site. 

The attacker creates a fake account and changes his e-mail. The attacker then creates a fake account and changes his
e-mail. The e-mail confirmation link can now be used to login someone into the fake account and then monitor
actions performed by the victim or even interact with him.

Please fix this.
