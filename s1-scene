Dear Security Team,

I have identified an issue within your application which allows me to perform an XSS attack. Please find the reproductive steps below: 

Log into your application at https://www.yourapp.com.

Once you are within the application, go back to the Login page by navigating to https://www.yourapp.com/Login.

Once you are back on the Login page, paste the following command into your browsers URL bar:

javascript:alert(1);

This will trigger the XSS attack on your site.

To remediate this, you need to consider all input from users as untrusted and sanitize all input that goes into the application.

Thank you,
Best Security Researcher Ever
