To whom it may concern,

During the course of testing your website, we have identified a SQL injection vulnerability within your application. To reproduce the issue, please see the following steps:

Log in at https://www.yoursite.com.

Once logged in, go to the Customerâ€™s Search function at the top.

Fill out the search fields as you would typically, but for country, put:' OR 1=1; -- 

After verifying the SQL injection existed, we pulled a portion of the database down using SQLMap. Please find the output below.

<Attached is the output from SQLMap>
