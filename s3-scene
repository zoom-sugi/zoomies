Hello,

During the course of testing your application, we’ve identified a bug in your application. It looks like maybe your caching emails and sending out cached 
versions of password reset emails. When I point Burp Intruder at your password reset page and I execute a bunch of password resets against my account, I’ll 
get a number of emails all containing the same password. It looks like your email service might just be resending the same email over and over.

I don't think this is a security issue, but it might be something you want to fix.

Thank you,
